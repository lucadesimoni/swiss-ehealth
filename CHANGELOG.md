# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
as scoped in [`docs/versioning.md`](docs/versioning.md).

Each released version below states the four compatibility numbers in force for
that release, so a deployment can be matched against its data without reading
the diff:

| | API | DB schema | Audit payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1.0 | v1 | 1 | 1 |

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-07

First release. API `v1`, DB schema `1`, audit payload `1`.

### Added

**Identity**
- AHVN13 (`756.…`) validation with EAN-13 check digit, and a `Ahvn13` type
  whose `repr` is masked so an accidental log statement cannot leak one.
- Derivation of a 256-bit pseudonymous person id (`ppid`), an allocated
  13-digit sector identifier (`761.…`, EPR-SPID shape) and a rotatable blind
  index. The AHV number itself is discarded, or kept only as an AEAD envelope
  bound to the pseudonym when `EHEALTH_STORE_SEALED_AHVN` is on.
- Controlled re-identification (`disclose_ahvn`) requiring a stated legal basis
  and auditing before decryption.
- Type-prefixed, time-sortable ULID-based UIDs for every entity; CHE-UID and
  GLN/GTIN validation.

**Access control**
- Capability tokens bound to one dossier, purpose, confidentiality ceiling and
  scope list, with a closed algorithm registry, versioned key ids, a database
  registry of every `jti` for revocation, optional proof-of-possession binding
  and a delegation chain.
- Consent model with participation status, default access level, per-person and
  per-institution rules where DENY beats ALLOW, `SECRET` clamped to
  patient-only, and emergency access capped below `SECRET`.
- Consent re-evaluated at every token use, not at issuance.
- Visitor grants: read-only, time-boxed, use-capped, issuable only by the
  patient, with write scopes clamped away.

**Audit and change tracking**
- Append-only hash-chained, Ed25519-signed audit ledger with periodic anchors
  and full chain verification.
- Bitemporal record revisions with redacted diffs, state hashes and a link to
  the ledger sequence number.
- Every ledger entry and anchor carries the `software_version` that wrote it and
  the `payload_version` of its signed layout.

**Clinical**
- Dossier and document management with confidentiality-level filtering applied
  in the query, supersession and retraction instead of deletion, and a 20-year
  retention horizon that moves with the last entry.
- Medication record covering prescription, dispense, administration and
  self-reported entries against a GTIN/Swissmedic/ATC catalogue, with a
  reconciled current medication list.

**Authentication**
- SwissID OIDC relying party: authorisation code flow with PKCE, server-side
  state and nonce, single-use flows, and full ID token verification against the
  provider JWKS.
- Mandatory emailed one-time second factor with keyed hashing, constant-time
  comparison, capped attempts and single use. A `PENDING_MFA` session carries no
  authority.
- Single-use refresh tokens with reuse detection that destroys the session.
- In-process mock identity provider for development, which refuses to be
  constructed in production.

**Operations**
- Configuration that refuses to start in production without a root key, with
  the mock IdP enabled, without SwissID credentials, over plaintext HTTP or on
  SQLite.
- Single root secret with HKDF-derived, versioned subkeys per purpose.
- Security headers, request correlation ids, and an admin-key-gated `/version`
  endpoint reporting build provenance.
- `make seed` demo walking the full journey and verifying the ledger.

### Security
- Denial paths commit their audit entry and attempt counters before raising, so
  a rejected login or token cannot be erased by the request rollback.
- Field-level AEAD is bound to the entity UID and column name, so a ciphertext
  cannot be transplanted onto another patient's row.

### Licence
- Released under AGPL-3.0-or-later. See [`docs/licensing.md`](docs/licensing.md)
  for the reasoning; the repository previously carried GPL-3.0.
